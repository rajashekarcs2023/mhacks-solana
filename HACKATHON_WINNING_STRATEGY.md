## üèóÔ∏è WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### Core Product
**Trader's Co-Pilot** - An MCP server that connects AI agents directly to Solana, enabling natural language trading interactions.

### Problem We're Solving
1. **Transaction Opacity**: Traders can't understand what they're signing
2. **Risk Blindness**: No clear risk flags or warnings before execution
3. **Complex UX**: Current tools require developer knowledge, not natural language
4. **Execution Anxiety**: Fear of making costly mistakes on-chain

### Our Solution
AI-powered Solana assistant that provides:
- **Plain English transaction explanations** with risk analysis
- **Real-time balance and price queries**
- **Safe trade previews** with slippage protection
- **One-click execution** through Actions/Blinks (stretch goal)

## üîß TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js HTTP server
- **Blockchain**: Solana Devnet via `@solana/web3.js`
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Safety**: Devnet-only guardrails, no private key handling

### MCP Tools (HTTP Endpoints)

#### 1. `get_balance(address)`
**Purpose**: Check SOL balance for any wallet  
**Input**: `{ "address": "base58_string" }`  
**Output**: `{ address, lamports, sol }`  
**Demo Value**: "What's in my wallet?" ‚Üí Instant balance check

#### 2. `explain_tx(signature)`
**Purpose**: Decode transactions into human-readable summaries  
**Input**: `{ "signature": "tx_signature" }`  
**Output**: `{ signature, summary, movements, accountsTouched, riskFlags }`  
**Risk Flags**: `tx_error`, `program_error`  
**Demo Value**: Paste any tx ‚Üí Get plain English explanation + warnings

#### 3. `market_buy_sim(mint, usdAmount, slippageBps)`
**Purpose**: Preview trades safely before execution  
**Input**: `{ mint, usdAmount, slippageBps, network }`  
**Output**: `{ preview: { plainEnglish, expectedFill, feeEstimate } }`  
**Demo Value**: "What if I buy $50 of SOL?" ‚Üí Clear preview with fees

#### 4. `airdrop_and_tip(to, sol)` (Optional)
**Purpose**: Prove safe execution capability on Devnet  
**Input**: `{ to, sol }`  
**Output**: `{ signature, preview, from }`  
**Demo Value**: One-click tip to demonstrate write functionality

### Safety Guardrails
```typescript
const SAFETY_CONFIG = {
  network: "devnet",           // Devnet-only by default
  maxSlippageBps: 150,         // Cap slippage at 1.5%
  refuseMainnetByDefault: true // Require explicit override
};
```

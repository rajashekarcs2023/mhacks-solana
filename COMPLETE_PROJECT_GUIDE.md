## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Trader's Co-Pilot** is the world's first AI-native Solana trading platform built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). We've created a comprehensive suite of 14 professional-grade tools that enable AI agents to safely interact with the Solana blockchain, analyze portfolios, detect MEV attacks, generate trading signals, and facilitate agent-to-agent payments.

### **🎪 The Magic Moment**
Imagine asking Claude: *"Is this wallet a whale?"* and discovering a **$77.8 MILLION portfolio** with 136 different tokens, analyzed in real-time with live price feeds. That's just one of our 14 revolutionary tools.
